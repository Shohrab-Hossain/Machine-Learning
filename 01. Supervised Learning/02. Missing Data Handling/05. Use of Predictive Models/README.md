  Use of Predictive Models

To prevent leaking, this should be done in conjunction with a cross-validation strategy. This can be quite useful and aid in the creation of the final model. A neural network is one of several possibilities for such a prediction model. Linear Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Maximum Likelihood, etc. are a few examples of prediction models.

Using the values from the missing data column, a predictive model is trained using this method, where the targets are the values of the missing-value column and the training values are the values of the other columns. The predictive algorithm then uses the corresponding data to predict the missing value.
