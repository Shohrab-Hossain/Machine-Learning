  Drop Data
</h1>

<br>

If missing data cannot be replaced, it may be dropped. Dropping can be done in either rows or columns. Drop in rows is applied if the number of missing values is very low, and drop in columns is applied if the number is high enough.


<br>


## a. Drop in Rows

If there are only a few missing values, the entire row that contains even one of them can be deleted. In this technique the data frame's number of columns remains constant while the number of rows is decreased.


<br>


## b. Drop in Columns

A column can be completely deleted if it has a lot of missing data. The data frame's number of columns is decreased but the number of rows is left unchanged by this column deletion.
