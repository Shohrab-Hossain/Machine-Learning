 Categorical Missing Data Handling
</h1>

<br>

Most categorical data are texts that cannot be processed as numeric data. To manage data that forms categories, the following techniques are used -


<br>


## a. Impute a New 'Missing' Category

This method creates an entirely new category by replacing all missing data with the word 'Missing'. The overall number of categories increases as a consequence of this approach. 


<br>


## b. Frequent Category Imputation

This approach examines the missing data column first, then chooses the category that appears the most frequently. And then all the missing data are replaced by this frequent column. This approach reinforces the total number of categories the same while increasing the count of the most frequent category.
